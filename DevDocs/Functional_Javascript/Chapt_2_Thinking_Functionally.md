# Chapter 2 - Thinking Functionally


In this chapter, we will do the following:

- Look at a simple, common, e-commerce related problem
- Consider several usual ways to solve it, with their associated defects
- Find a way to solve the problem by looking at it functionally
- Devise a higher-order solution that can be applied to other problems
- Work out how to carry out unit testing for functional solutions

This chapter is an overview.  These topics will be addressed in greater detail in later chapters.
