# Chapter 9 - Designing Functions; Recursion

Here, we are going to get into a different theme: how to actually design and write functions, in a typically functional
way, by applying recursive techniques.

We will be covering the following topics:

- Understanding what recursion is and how to think in order to produce recursive solutions
- Applying recursion to some well-known problems, such as making a change or the Tower of Hanoi
- Using recursion instead of iteration to re-implement some higher-order functions from earlier chapters
- Writing search and backtrack algorithms with ease
- Traversing data structures, such as trees, to work with file system directories or with the browser DOM
- Getting around some limitations caused by browser JavaScript engine considerations

***Note***: *This is a ***Fantastic*** chapter.  However, for the sake of time and pushing forward with other concepts,
this chapter is being skipped for now.  By all means other readers of these notes can feel free to fill this in.* :-)
