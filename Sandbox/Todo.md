## Design Concepts

- Reduce DDD concepts into minimal Functional components
- Decompose Layers and Components
- Decompose Domain Business Logic, Event Sourcing and  Command Services
- Generic Modularization of Codebase.  E.g. Domain should be separate from UI
- Document / Identify expected Pure vs Impure Function Components
  - Outer 'ring' of architecture contains all of the impure functions needed to provide interaction

## Proof of Concepts

- LocalStorage in Node.js
- JSON Schema Validation
- Immutability
- Pub/Sub Brokers
- Document Store with 'LocalStorage' API
- JSON Schema definitions
- JSON Schema validator
- Messaging Subsystem; Conceptual Design and Implementation details
- Render Application Information in Footer
    - Application Build ID from git commit hash
    - Application Metadata in JSON File (Name, BuildQuality, etc)
- Event Store
  - Eventual Consistency
- Memoization in Repository Persistence functionality
- Download Application State as an ASCII JSON document
- Download Document State ""
- Download Document Markdown
- Download Document HTML
